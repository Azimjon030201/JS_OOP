# 👥 Count Number of Instances

## Description
Create a class named **User** and create a way to check the number of users (number of instances) that were created, so that the value can be accessed as a **class attribute**.

---

## 🧩 Examples

```js
u1 = new User("johnsmith10")
User.userCount ➞ 1

u2 = new User("marysue1989")
User.userCount ➞ 2

u3 = new User("milan_rodrick")
User.userCount ➞ 3
```

Make sure that the usernames are accessible via the **instance attribute** `username`.

```js
u1.username ➞ "johnsmith10"
u2.username ➞ "marysue1989"
u3.username ➞ "milan_rodrick"
```
