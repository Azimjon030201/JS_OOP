# 📚 Book Shelf

## Description
Create a **Book constructor** that has two properties:

- **Title**
- **Author**

and two methods:

- A method named **getTitle()** that returns:  
  `"Title: " + the instance title.`
- A method named **getAuthor()** that returns:  
  `"Author: " + the instance author.`

---

## Task
Instantiate this constructor by creating **3 new books**:

| Title               | Author               | Variable Name |
|---------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Pride and Prejudice | Jane Austen          | `PP`           |
| Hamlet              | William Shakespeare  | `H`            |
| War and Peace       | Leo Tolstoy          | `WP`           |

The name of the new object instances are **PP**, **H**, and **WP**, respectively.

## Example
If I instantiated the following book using this Book constructor function:

**Harry Potter - J.K. Rowling (HP)**

I would get the following properties and methods:

```js
HP.title ➞ "Harry Potter"
HP.author ➞ "J.K. Rowling"
HP.getTitle() ➞ "Title: Harry Potter"
HP.getAuthor() ➞ "Author: J.K. Rowling"
