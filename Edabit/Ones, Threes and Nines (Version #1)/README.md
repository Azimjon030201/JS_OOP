Ones, Threes and Nines (Version #1)
Given an int, figure out how many ones, threes and nines you could fit into the number. You must create a class. You will make variables (class.ones, class.threes, class.nines) to do this.

Examples
let n1 = new OnesThreesNines(5)
n1.nines ➞ 0

n1.ones ➞ 5

n1.threes ➞ 1
Notes.
This was originally a Python problem over here.
See another Python version of this series.
I'd suggest using getters and setters for this, but you're welcome to use any method you choose!
