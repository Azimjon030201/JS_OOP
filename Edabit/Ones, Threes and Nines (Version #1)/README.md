## Ones, Threes and Nines (Version #1)

Given an **int**, figure out how many **ones**, **threes**, and **nines** you could fit into the number. You must create a **class**. You will make variables (`class.ones`, `class.threes`, `class.nines`) to do this.

---

### Examples

```js
let n1 = new OnesThreesNines(5);
n1.nines;   // → 0
n1.ones;    // → 5
n1.threes;  // → 1
